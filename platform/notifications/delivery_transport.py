"""Shared HTTP-post transport for outbound message-delivery helpers.

Slack, Discord, and Telegram delivery modules each issue a JSON ``POST``
to a provider endpoint, parse the response body, and return a
``(success, error, ...)`` tuple. The transport pieces of that flow —
making the request, applying a timeout, catching network exceptions, and
attempting JSON decode — are identical; only the success criteria,
authentication scheme, and error-message extraction differ per provider.

This module hosts the shared transport so each delivery module can keep
its provider-specific payload building and result interpretation while
sharing one well-tested HTTP code path.

The helper deliberately does **not** decide whether the call succeeded
at the provider level. It returns ``ok=True`` whenever the request
completed without raising; callers then inspect ``status_code`` and
``data``/``text`` to apply provider semantics (e.g. ``data["ok"]`` for
Slack, ``status_code in (HTTPStatus.OK, HTTPStatus.CREATED)`` for Discord,
``status_code == HTTPStatus.OK`` for Telegram).

    Attributes:
        ok: ``True`` iff the request completed without raising. This is a
            transport-level signal only; provider-level success requires
            inspecting ``status_code`` / ``data`` per provider semantics.
        status_code: HTTP status code from the response, or ``0`` when the
            request itself raised before a response was received.
        data: Parsed JSON body when the response was a JSON object,
            otherwise an empty mapping. Never ``None``, so callers can
            chain ``.get(...)`` safely without a None-check. The mapping
            is read-only (``MappingProxyType``) so the frozen dataclass
            stays fully immutable end-to-end.
        text: Raw response body, useful for fallback error extraction
            when the body is not valid JSON or is empty.
        error: String form of the exception that aborted the request.
            Empty when ``ok`` is True.
        exc_type: Class name of the exception that aborted the request
            (e.g. ``"TimeoutError"``, ``"ConnectError"``). Empty when
            ``ok`` is True. Surfaced separately so callers can include
            the exception shape in triage logs without parsing ``error``.
            Named ``exc_type`` rather than ``type`` because ``type`` is
            a Python builtin.
