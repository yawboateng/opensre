## OpenSRE Development Reference

## Build and Run commands

- Build `make install` (sets up the project environment via `uv sync` and installs this repo in editable mode)
- Run **`uv run opensre …`** from the repo root while developing — preferred approach, uses this checkout even if another `opensre` is on your `PATH`.
- Use **`uv run python …`** for any Python commands.

## Code Style

- Use strict typing, follow DRY principle
- One clear purpose per file (separation of concerns)
- Use named constants for HTTP status codes (`http.HTTPStatus`, e.g.
  `HTTPStatus.PAYMENT_REQUIRED`) in both source and tests — never hardcoded
  numeric literals like `402`.
- Env-var names and shared static constants live under `config/`, never inline
  in a feature module or duplicated across files. Put them in a domain module
  under `config/constants/` (e.g. `config/constants/billing.py`,
  `config/constants/llm.py`) — a leaf that any layer can import without a cycle —
  and re-export via `config/constants/__init__.py`. Do **not** define shared env
  names in `config/config.py`: it imports `config.llm_auth.*`, so a name it and
  one of those modules both need would force a cyclic import. Only a name used
  solely inside `config/config.py` (nothing it imports needs it) may live there.
- Do not keep compatibility-only forwarding modules after refactors. Once imports and tests
  are migrated, remove the old module path in the same change and use one canonical import path.
- Test fakes: never inline a lambda that builds an ad-hoc `type(...)` object (or
  nests another lambda) into `monkeypatch.setattr` / `patch`. Extract a named
  `def` and pass it — `type(...)` inside the helper body is fine:

  ```python
  def _build_harness() -> Any:
      return type("H", (), {"resolve_env_variables": lambda _self: None})()

  monkeypatch.setattr(startup, "_build_harness", _build_harness)
  ```

  Trivial lambdas (`lambda **_kw: None`, `lambda: sentinel`) stay inline.
  Precedent: `gateway/tests/runtime/test_startup.py` (`_StubHarness`),
  `tests/cli/test_integrations_setup_github.py` (`_prompt_answering`).
- Protocol methods you **add or change** use a **docstring-only body** — no
  `...`, no `pass`, no `raise NotImplementedError`, and never a docstring *plus*
  a trailing `...`/`pass`. Precedent (all fully compliant):
  `platform/filestorage/ports.py`, `platform/deployment_contracts/ports.py`,
  `core/agent/loop_host.py`, `gateway/runtime/sink_protocol.py`,
  `core/llm/types.py`.

  ```python
  class ObjectStore(Protocol):
      def put_object(self, key: str, data: bytes) -> None:
          """Store ``data`` under ``key``."""
  ```

  **The codebase is not yet compliant, and no tool will tell you.** An AST scan
  of product code counts 89 docstring-only Protocol methods against **108
  `raise NotImplementedError` stubs in 23 files** (`core/agent_harness/ports.py`,
  `platform/harness_ports.py`, `gateway/storage/session/binding_store.py` and
  others). Those are pre-existing and out of scope for a drive-by — do not
  mass-convert them, and do not cite a file as precedent without checking it.

  Enforcement is review-only:
  - CodeQL `py/ineffectual-statement` catches **only** the bare `...` form.
  - `pass` and `raise NotImplementedError` trip nothing.
  - mypy exempts Protocol bodies from "missing return", so `pass` under a
    `-> list[str]` signature passes `make typecheck`.

### Docs under `docs/`

**Keep docs in sync with every change — this is not optional.** Any change that
adds, removes, or alters user-visible behavior, configuration, env vars, CLI
commands, tools, or integrations MUST, in the *same* change:

- **Update every existing doc the change affects** — feature pages, the relevant
  reference/overview tables, `.env.example`, and any cross-cutting index page
  (e.g. a new `<SERVICE>_INSTANCES` env means updating both the service page and
  [docs/multi-instance-integrations.mdx](docs/multi-instance-integrations.mdx)).
  Grep `docs/` for the feature/flag/command name before you finish; a stale doc
  is a defect.
- **Create a new page when no existing doc covers the behavior**, and wire it
  into [`docs/docs.json`](docs/docs.json) `pages` (an unlisted `.mdx` is
  unreachable — see Footguns).

`docs/` is user-facing. Test every sentence: *does this change what the reader
does?* If not, cut it.

- Cut vendor API endpoints (`getMe`), internal function names, which credential
  tier a value lands in, and the bug a change fixed — that belongs in the PR
  description or a module docstring.
- Keep required vs optional, shortcuts that save real work, gotchas that are
  invisible until they bite, and the exact commands and env vars they type.
- Say "a chat the bot was never added to fails during setup", not "`getChat`
  returns `ok: false`".

### Performance (algorithms & data structures)

Apply on the **hot path** (per-request / per-iteration / per-tool-call); leave cold
code simple. Complexity must be deliberate — the simplest structure that meets the
asymptotic need, and no more.

- **Membership / dedup in a loop → `set`/`dict`, never `x in list`.** List `in` is
  O(n); a set is O(1). (frozen dataclasses are hashable, so `set()` works on them.)
- **Resolve once, reuse.** Don't re-scan for something already looked up — if you
  fetched an object from a map, read its fields directly instead of a second linear
  scan. Build an O(1) `{name: obj}` map instead of scanning a list by name.
- **No `deepcopy` / `json.dumps` on the hot path.** If the result is invariant after
  construction, compute it once (`functools.cached_property` / a stored field) and
  treat it read-only. Verify no caller mutates a shared cached object first.
- **Sort the light thing, once.** Sort keys/names (strings), not heavy objects, and
  don't re-sort the same collection twice for two outputs.
- **Right structure for the job:** `collections.deque` for queues/both-ends,
  `heapq` for top-k, `bisect` for sorted search, `OrderedDict.move_to_end` /
  `functools.lru_cache` for bounded caches, `"".join(parts)` never `+=` in a loop.
- **Behavior-preserving refactors are TDD-guarded:** add a characterization test that
  pins the observable behavior, confirm it passes on the *pre*-refactor code, then
  keep it green through the change. Optimize only after; keep any benchmark in the PR.

### File placement (all packages)

When adding or changing behavior, put code in the **owning module first** — not the nearest
shared file that already imports something similar.

| Kind of file | Should contain | Should not contain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Orchestration** (`flow.py`, `controller.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `factory.py`) | Stage ordering, wiring, dispatch to specialists | Vendor/provider/domain logic, API clients, heavy UI |
| **Shared UI / prompts** (`_ui.py`, `prompts.py`, generic `validation.py`) | Reusable prompts, tables, rendering, thin dispatch | Logic for one provider, integration, or vendor |
| **Domain / provider / vendor module** (`providers/<name>.py`, `surfaces/cli/wizard/<name>.py`, `integrations/<vendor>/`) | All behavior specific to that provider, vendor, or feature area | Unrelated providers or cross-cutting orchestration |
| **Registry / catalog** (`config.py`, `*_catalog.py`, `provider_registry.py`) | Metadata, defaults, discovery tables | Live API calls, onboarding prompts, retry loops |

**Rules:**

1. **Two or more functions for the same provider, vendor, or feature area** → add or extend
   a dedicated module (or subpackage) for that area. Do not grow a shared orchestration or UI
   file with provider-specific branches.
2. **Before editing a shared file**, check for an existing sibling pattern in the same
   package (`local_llm/`, `providers/azure_openai.py`, `integrations/<vendor>/tools/`, etc.).
   Match that layout before inventing a new one.
3. **Keep dispatch thin.** Shared entrypoints (`validate_provider_credentials`, `get_llm`,
   slash-command handlers) should delegate in a few lines; implementation lives downstream.
4. **Respect package boundaries** in [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Surfaces compose
   lower tiers; `core/` and `integrations/` do not import from `surfaces/`.
5. **Package-local detail** lives in that package's `AGENTS.md` when present (e.g.
   [`surfaces/interactive_shell/AGENTS.md`](surfaces/interactive_shell/AGENTS.md),
   [`core/llm/AGENTS.md`](core/llm/AGENTS.md)). Read it before structural changes in that tree.
6. **Tool location** follows [docs/tool-placement-policy.md](docs/tool-placement-policy.md)
   (vendor-specific vs `tools/system/` vs cross-vendor).

If a change would add a new provider-specific `if provider.value == ...` block to a file
that already serves multiple providers, stop and extract a dedicated module instead.

Before any push or PR creation follow [**CI.md**](CI.md) — lint, format, typecheck, and test commands all live there.

When opening a PR, fill out the [**PR template**](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) — it is not optional boilerplate; it has a required AI-usage disclosure section.

## 2. Entry Points

### Adding a Tool

The tool registry auto-discovers modules under `tools/`, so the normal path is to add one module or package there and let discovery pick it up. See [docs/adding-tools-and-integrations.md](docs/adding-tools-and-integrations.md) for the full file list and the detailed definition of done (package structure, contract/implementation rules, live-payload parsing, required docs/tests).

Steps:

1. Pick the simplest shape that fits the tool. Use a `BaseTool` subclass (from `core.tool_framework.base`) for richer behavior; use `@tool(...)` from `core.tool_framework.tool_decorator` for a lightweight function tool.
2. Declare clear metadata: `name`, `description`, `source`, `input_schema`, and any `use_cases`, `requires`, `outputs`, or `retrieval_controls` you need.
3. Before opening or approving the PR, follow [docs/adding-tools-and-integrations.md](docs/adding-tools-and-integrations.md).

### Changing the investigation pipeline

Investigations are coordinated in `tools/investigation/lifecycle.py` and exposed via
`tools/investigation/capability.py`. Semantic stages live under
`tools/investigation/stages/`; reporting lives under
`tools/investigation/reporting/`. See
[docs/investigation-pipeline-architecture.md](docs/investigation-pipeline-architecture.md)
for the end-to-end stage/loop diagrams before making structural changes.

Files to touch:

- `tools/investigation/lifecycle.py` for high-level stage ordering.
- `core/state/` for shared agent state and investigation pipeline slice contracts
  that cross stage boundaries.
- `core/domain/` for pure investigation rules (alert source mapping, tool planning,
  category alignment, correlation scoring).
- `core/` for shared LLM runtime helpers (tool loop and LLM invoke error
  classification).
- `core/state/*.py` when adding or renaming persisted investigation fields
  (update `AgentStateModel` and the matching slice).
- `docs/` — update or add a page if the change introduces user-visible behavior or configuration.
- `tests/` coverage for the affected CLI, synthetic, or integration paths.

Steps:

1. Keep each stage focused on one responsibility.
2. Extend state models when new fields cross stage boundaries.
3. Update tests that exercise `run_investigation` / streaming entry points.

### Adding an Integration

Integration work usually spans config normalization, verification, integration-local clients/helpers, tools, docs, and tests. See [docs/adding-tools-and-integrations.md](docs/adding-tools-and-integrations.md) for the full file list, examples from the repo (Datadog, Grafana, Hermes), and the detailed definition of done (core completeness, investigation wiring, docs/tests, `make verify-integrations`, final demo gate).

Steps:

1. Add the integration config and normalization logic first so the rest of the stack can consume a consistent shape.
2. Wire the tool layer after the config path is stable.
3. Before opening or approving the PR, follow [docs/adding-tools-and-integrations.md](docs/adding-tools-and-integrations.md).

## 3. Footguns (common mistakes to avoid)

- No planning-stage fail-closed safeguard (v0.1): the interactive-shell action planner never denies a turn — do **not** reintroduce a planner denial, `mark_unhandled`, or the `UNHANDLED:` convention. Full rationale: [docs/interactive-shell-action-policy.md](docs/interactive-shell-action-policy.md); package rule: `surfaces/interactive_shell/AGENTS.md` ("Action Selection And Execution").
- Docs navigation: Adding an `.mdx` file under `docs/` is not enough — Mintlify only shows pages listed in `docs/docs.json`. Forgetting the `pages` entry leaves the doc unreachable from the site sidebar.
- Investigation tool schemas: draft-07 JSON Schema (e.g. `"type": ["object", "null"]`) can pass loose checks but fail the LLM API on first invoke because **all** available investigation tools are sent together. Normalize in the provider adapter and extend registry contract tests; see [docs/investigation-tool-calling.md](docs/investigation-tool-calling.md).
- Interactive-shell action selection: do not implement regex/keyword/fuzzy intent routing or deterministic action bypasses around the action-agent path. See `surfaces/interactive_shell/AGENTS.md` ("Action Selection And Execution") for the full rule and the sanctioned literal-`/slash` exception.
- Information exposure through an exception (CWE-209 / CodeQL `py/stack-trace-exposure`): never send an exception's detail — `str(exc)`, `repr(exc)`, `traceback.format_exc()`, `exc.args`, provider/model/field internals — to an **external surface**. External surfaces are HTTP responses (`JSONResponse`/`HTTPException.detail` in `gateway/http/`) and chat gateway messages delivered to Slack/Telegram users (`OutputSink.render_error` on the gateway sinks). Log full detail server-side (`logger` + `capture_exception`) and return a generic message or `type(exc).__name__` only. The local CLI/terminal sink is **not** external — it may show detail. Redact at the sink/response boundary, not per call site, so the shared turn engine keeps detail for local dev.
- Cyclic imports (CodeQL `py/cyclic-import`): CodeQL counts **function-local** and `TYPE_CHECKING` imports as part of a cycle, so making an import lazy does **not** clear the alert. Break the cycle structurally — move the shared symbol (type, exception, helper) into a **leaf** module both sides import, and never add a back-edge from a lower-level module up to a higher-level one. Precedent: `surfaces/cli/wizard/validation_result.py` and `surfaces/cli/llm_auth/persist.py` exist only to hold shared symbols so `validation` ↔ `azure_openai` and `_ui` → `service` stay acyclic.
- CodeQL does not model `NoReturn`: it treats `pytest.skip`, `pytest.fail`, `sys.exit`, `typer.Exit` and custom raise-helpers as if they return, so any code after them looks reachable. Two alerts come from this — `py/uninitialized-local-variable` when a name is bound in `try` and the `except` only calls such a function, and unreachable-code when a `with` body ends in a bare `raise`. Do **not** silence with a comment: bind the name on every path CodeQL can see. Prefer a sentinel over exception control flow for ordinary "not found" — `next(iterable, None)` plus an explicit `if x is None:` guard, not `try: next(...) except StopIteration:`. `mypy` narrows correctly after the guard because it *does* honour `NoReturn`. For the bare-`raise` case, extract a `_raise()` helper.
- Protocol stub bodies (CodeQL `py/ineffectual-statement`): a bare `...` on a
  `Protocol` method is a valid PEP-544 idiom but trips CodeQL as a statement
  with no effect. Do **not** write `def foo(self) -> T: ...`. Use a one-line
  docstring as the only body (see Code Style above), and do not keep both a
  docstring and a trailing `...`/`pass`. Prefer documenting the contract on the
  port over silencing the alert with a comment. Note the scope: CodeQL catches
  only `...`, so a clean scan does **not** mean the codebase follows the rule —
  `pass` and `raise NotImplementedError` are invisible to it, and 108 of the
  latter remain.
- `py/ineffectual-statement` does **not** understand `await`: a bare
  `await some_task` reads to CodeQL as a discarded expression. It is not — the
  await is the side effect (e.g. reaping a cancelled task so `client.close()`
  runs). Do **not** delete the await. Prefer a small helper that binds the
  result (`_finished = await task` in `gateway/discord/worker.py`
  `_reap_cancelled_task`) over a bare expression statement; do not "fix" by
  skipping the await.
- Implicit string concatenation in a list (CodeQL
  `py/implicit-string-concatenation-in-list`): two adjacent string literals
  inside a list/tuple display are indistinguishable from a **missing comma**,
  so a long message split over two lines trips it. Do not silence it with an
  explicit `+` — extract the text to a module constant and reference that. The
  same implicit concatenation is fine in a parenthesised assignment, where no
  comma could have been intended. Precedent:
  `tools/system/python_execution_tool/__init__.py`
  (`_RUNTIME_FACTS_ANTI_EXAMPLE`). Bites hardest in `use_cases` /
  `anti_examples` / `examples` tool metadata, where entries are prose and
  routinely exceed the 100-char line limit.
- Mixed import styles (CodeQL `py/import-and-import-from`): importing one
  module with both `import X as alias` and `from X import name` — even when
  the `from` import is function-local — raises an alert. It usually happens
  when appending to an existing file: **use the import style the file already
  established** (an existing `import core.context_budget as budget` means new
  code calls `budget.name`, not `from core.context_budget import name`).
- Shared client state under concurrent turns: LLM clients are cached per role
  (`get_llm`) and the gateway runs turns in parallel, so **one client instance
  serves several in-flight requests**. An instance flag mutated inside an error
  handler is then read by requests that were already built under the old value.
  Branch on **what the current request carried**, not on the flag's present
  value — capture the fact locally where the request is built
  (`marked = strip_cache_markers(kwargs) != kwargs`) and consult that in the
  `except`. Precedent: the prompt-cache fallback, where a first 400 cleared
  `_cache_markers_enabled` and a second already-marked request skipped its
  uncached retry and failed the turn. Test it by having the fake dependency
  mutate the shared state *before* raising, which reproduces the race
  deterministically without threads.
- CI typecheck does **not** cover `tests/`: `make typecheck` runs mypy over `PYTHON_SOURCE_PATHS` (`config core gateway integrations platform surfaces tools`) only. Type errors in test files never fail CI, so do not assume a clean `make typecheck` means the tests you just wrote are type-clean — run mypy on the test path directly when it matters.
