"""``make test-scope`` must route a GCP change to the GCP tests.

Before this rule, ``integrations/gcp/**`` fell through to the
``PathRule("integrations/", ("tests/integrations/",))`` catch-all, which runs
``tests/integrations/`` and nothing under ``tests/tools/``. So a change to a GCP
tool's schema, surfaces or telemetry registration ran none of the tests that
assert on them, and the first red was whatever full-suite run happened next.

``classify`` breaks on the **first** matching prefix, so this is also an
ordering guard: moving the GCP rule below the ``integrations/`` catch-all makes
it unreachable without changing either rule's contents.
