"""One answer to "which organization does this process serve".

Consumers spread across billing, analytics, Slack principal resolution and the
context-mount ownership check all read the same value through
:func:`organization_id`. The regression that motivates these tests: when a
deployment declared its organization under a name the product did not read, the
silo resolved an empty string and refused every Slack turn.
