"""Loading a skill must not print anything through the generic formatter.

``skill_view`` returns the full recipe so the *model* can follow it. The
user-facing event ("Skill <name>" / "↳ Skill activated") is rendered live by
the surface's tool-event observer, so the end-of-turn generic formatter must
stay silent: any output here would double-print the activation, and falling
through to the payload would dump the entire 5k-character skill body —
escaped JSON, box-drawing characters and all — onto the user's screen.
