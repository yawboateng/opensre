"""Tool output must never be parsed as terminal markup.

A skill body, shell stdout, or model reply can contain square brackets — the
morning-report recipe embeds ``sed -E 's/<title><!\\[CDATA\\[//; s/\\]\\]>//'``.
Rendered as markup that reads as an unbalanced tag and raises ``MarkupError``,
which killed the whole turn with "turn error: closing tag ... doesn't match any
open tag" and no briefing.

The guard belongs at the surface: ``core/agent_harness/AGENTS.md`` forbids the
harness from depending on Rich, so the harness passes literal text and the sink
decides how to render it.
