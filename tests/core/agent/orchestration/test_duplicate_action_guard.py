"""Hook-level tests for the duplicate-action guard's snapshot rules.

The end-to-end cases live in ``test_agent_actions_harness.py``, which drives a
whole action turn per case. These drive ``with_duplicate_action_call_guard``
directly so each ``before_tool_batch`` branch — full success, mixed, and
retain — is pinned on its own, along with the argument normalization that
decides whether two calls count as identical.
