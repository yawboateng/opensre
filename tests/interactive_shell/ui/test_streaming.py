        code blocks must keep accumulating across paragraphs until a
        line-start closing fence arrives — the mid-line backticks are
        inline content (often quoted/embedded in prose), not Markdown
        syntax.

        Regression for the drive-by review point: a chunk like
        ``\\nresult: ok\\`\\`\\`\\nmore text`` (closing-fence-shaped
        characters mid-line because the chunk boundary fell there)
        used to be a worry. The ``^\\`\\`\\``` regex with
        ``re.MULTILINE`` matches only line-start fences, so this
        scenario stays correct.
