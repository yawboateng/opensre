"""Suggested-loops startup picker.

When the interactive shell starts and no scheduled tasks ("loops") are
configured on this machine, offer three suggested recurring loops in an inline
dropdown. Picking one auto-submits a canned prompt as the first turn; the
action agent then drives the matching bundled skill (``github-ci-fix``,
``github-cli``, ``morning-report``) through a first demo pass and the existing
``propose_scheduled_delivery`` → ``/cron add`` confirmation flow. Escape skips
into the normal prompt for this launch — nothing is persisted, so the picker
returns on the next launch while zero loops exist.

This is deterministic startup UI plus a canned prompt: the routing of that
prompt stays with the action agent (no intent heuristics — see
``surfaces/interactive_shell/AGENTS.md``, "Action Selection And Execution").
