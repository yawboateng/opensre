"""The child process the gateway daemon spawns.

A leaf: it imports only ``sys`` / ``pathlib``, so the CLI command and the
interactive shell's ``/gateway`` command can both read it without either
pulling in the other's package. Naming it inside ``surfaces.cli.gateway_entry``
instead would make the shell import the CLI entrypoint, which re-enters the
shell's own command registry mid-import.

It lives under ``surfaces`` rather than ``gateway`` because the surface owns
its composition root; the gateway supervises whatever child it is handed.

Frozen / ``opensre`` binaries cannot take ``python -m …`` — that sends ``-m``
to Click. Those builds re-enter via ``gateway start --foreground`` so the
child runs the composition root attached (no second daemon spawn).
