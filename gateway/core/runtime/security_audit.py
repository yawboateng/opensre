"""Append-only record of security-relevant gateway actions.

One JSON object per line under ``~/.opensre/gateway/security-audit.jsonl``,
covering approval create/resolve/expire and investigation create/cancel, so
the record outlives the process that wrote it.

Scope, which is narrower than "audit log" usually implies:

- **One host, one file.** The path is host-global, not per-org-silo.
- **The lock serializes writers in one process only.** Concurrent gateway
  workers append to the same file without coordination, so ordering across
  processes is whatever the filesystem gives. This is not a shared audit
  store for a multi-worker or multi-host deployment.
- **Writes are best-effort.** A failed append is logged and swallowed; it
  must never fail the caller's action.
- **``detail`` is caller-supplied and unvalidated.** Keeping bodies and
  secrets out of it is a contract with callers, not something enforced here.
