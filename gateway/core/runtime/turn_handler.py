"""Dispatch one inbound gateway message through the shared headless agent.

This is the **only** gateway turn handler. Transport dispatchers
(Slack/Discord/Telegram) are ingress adapters: they authorize, resolve a
session, build a sink, then call this callback. Process-wide capacity is an
optional gate on the same object — not a second handler.

Transport-agnostic: takes ``(text, session, sink, logger)``, runs the turn, and
finalizes outbound text on the sink. Agent reuse is handled by
:class:`SessionAgentPool`.
