"""Where the gateway's session-binding index lives.

Session bindings map a conversation to a session inside one organization, so
they follow that organization's context root — the mounted volume in a deployed
service.

The team → organization mapping is deliberately absent: it is control-plane
data the webapp already owns, so this process reads it from configuration
rather than keeping a copy.

Not SQLite: the context root is an NFS-backed mount, where SQLite's advisory
locking is unreliable.
