"""Session binding store construction.

Bindings live in a JSON file beside the rest of a principal's context — no
database, and no SQLite: the context root is an NFS-backed mount where SQLite's
advisory locking is unreliable, while a write-temp-then-rename is atomic. One
writer at a time, which the Slack gateway already is (Socket Mode is
single-consumer).
