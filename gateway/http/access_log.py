"""Keep uvicorn's HTTP access log signal-bearing under Kubernetes probes.

A liveness/readiness probe hits ``/health`` and ``/healthz`` every few seconds,
so on a long-running pod the access log becomes a wall of identical 200s that
say nothing. A *failing* probe, on the other hand, is exactly what an operator
needs to see — so only successful probe requests are dropped here; anything
4xx/5xx, and every non-probe route, logs unchanged.

Sibling of :mod:`gateway.config.logging_config`, which does the same job for the
gateway daemon's own package logs.
