"""Smoke tests for per-org credit metering: safe default posture + wired happy path.

These exercise the whole path through real env resolution (not surgical patches of
internals), covering the two operational states a deploy actually sees: metering
off (local/dev, nothing configured) and a fully configured silo whose ledger
accepts the charge.
