"""Gateway process boot: one named step, in a fixed order.

``start_gateway`` opened with thirteen statements of process setup — harness
construction, env resolution, adapter registration, Sentry, capability warnings,
LLM preload — before any gateway-specific work. None of it is gateway logic, and
the ordering constraints between the steps were documented only as inline
comments inside a lifecycle method.

The order is load-bearing and is what these tests pin:

* env variables resolve **before** adapters register, because adapter/integration
  hydration can depend on env-provided credentials;
* the LLM client graph preloads **after** adapters, so the snapshot sees the
  registered set;
* capability warnings are emitted at startup, before the first mid-turn failure can
  present as a confusing answer.
