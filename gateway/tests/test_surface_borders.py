"""Regression borders: only Slack org turns may change, and only their own data.

Three surfaces share one process and one filesystem: the local CLI, Telegram,
and Slack. Scoping was introduced for Slack alone, so each test here fixes one
edge of that boundary — either "this surface is untouched" or "this Slack turn
cannot reach anything but its own".

The deployed Slack task always has ``OPENSRE_CONTEXT_ROOT`` set, so most tests
configure the mount and then assert what *does not* reach it.
