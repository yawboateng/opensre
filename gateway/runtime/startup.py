"""Everything the gateway process does once, before any component starts.

Distinct from :mod:`gateway.runtime.bootstrap`, which registers harness
adapters and scheduler runners — one step of the sequence below.

``start_gateway`` is a lifecycle method: assemble the turn handler, start the
components, own the signals. The process-level setup underneath it — resolving
env vars, registering harness adapters, error reporting, capability probes,
warming the LLM client graph — is not gateway logic and does not belong there.

Order is load-bearing:

1. **env variables** first, because adapter and integration hydration can depend
   on credentials supplied through the environment;
2. **harness adapters** next, so the tool and integration registries are
   populated;
3. **LLM clients** last, so the preloaded snapshot reflects the registered set.

Sentry and the capability probes sit between them: both are diagnostics, and the
capability warnings are deliberately emitted at boot so a withheld capability
reads as a startup warning rather than a confusing mid-turn answer.

GKE auto-registration also sits in that gap, but is not part of the ordering: it
runs on a background thread and nothing below waits for it.
