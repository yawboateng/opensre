"""Thread-safe registry of approval prompts awaiting a text reply.

Written by :class:`gateway.transports.buzz.approvals.BuzzApprovalPrompter` on
the turn's executor thread; read by the poll loop
(:mod:`gateway.transports.buzz.background`) on the asyncio loop thread — the
lock is what makes that safe, mirroring
:class:`gateway.core.runtime.approvals.ApprovalBroker`'s own locking.

Each entry carries the *request's* own authority, not just its approval id.
Buzz channels are multi-member, and a reply only has to quote the prompt's
event id to reach the poll loop — so matching on the prompt alone would let
any other participant approve or deny somebody else's protected write. The
requester and the channel the prompt was posted in are therefore part of the
match, on top of the live identity-policy check the poll loop still runs.
