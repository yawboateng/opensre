"""Buzz text-reply approval prompt for write tools.

Buzz has no interactive buttons. The mention-poll loop that triggers new
turns (:mod:`gateway.transports.buzz.background`) also recognizes a reply to
a pending approval prompt — via ``pending_approvals``, shared through
:class:`gateway.transports.buzz.runtime.BuzzPollingRuntime` — and resolves it
directly instead of starting a new turn. A plain "approve"/"deny" reply is
enough: Buzz Desktop auto-tags the prompt's author (this agent) on any reply
to it, so it still surfaces in the mention feed with no explicit @mention.

The prompt is answerable only by the member whose turn raised it, in the
channel it was posted to — see
:class:`gateway.transports.buzz.pending_approvals.PendingApprovals`.
