    turn that finished during a cancelled shutdown from being replayed — the
    thread outlives the cancelled ``await``, so waiting for that ``await`` to
    return would drop the acknowledgement for work whose side effects already
    landed. The trailing call covers the paths that never reach the executor
    at all, such as an unauthorized sender. Both are idempotent: the poller
    only counts the first.

    A turn that raises is still acknowledged: the failure is logged, and a
    message that reliably crashes its own turn would otherwise be redelivered
    on every poll forever. A turn cancelled *before* its body ran is not, and
