    rest; cancelling an asyncio task does **not** stop the underlying
    ``run_in_executor`` thread. Waiting for those threads here
    (``wait=True``) would push the Buzz background thread past the gateway's
    ~8s ``stop()`` join budget and make ``stop()`` report failure even though
    unfinished work is intentionally unacked and re-delivered on next start.

    ``cancel_futures=True`` drops work still queued on the pool; in-flight
    threads may briefly outlive this call (same trade-off as Discord's
    ``wait=False`` shutdown).
