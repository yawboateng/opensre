class BuzzFeedPoller:
    """Poll the mention feed and yield normalized inbound messages.

    **The cursor tracks handled work, not fetched work.** ``poll_once`` marks
    what it returns as in flight; only :meth:`acknowledge` — called once a turn
    has actually run — records it as handled. A turn that dies mid-flight, or
    that shutdown cuts short, is therefore re-delivered on the next start
    instead of being silently skipped.

    Two rules define the whole thing:

    * ``_since`` may cover a second only once no in-flight turn sits at or
      below it, because ``feed get --since`` is inclusive (NIP-01: matches
      ``created_at >= since``) and has one-second resolution. Advancing onto
      an in-flight event's second would skip it on restart.
    * ``_handled`` holds every handled event at or above ``_since``, and is
      persisted whole on every acknowledgement. Turns finish out of order, so
      a newer completion routinely cannot be folded into the watermark yet —
      keeping it only in memory is what makes it replay after a restart.

    Everything strictly below ``_since`` is handled by definition, so pruning
    those IDs keeps both the map and the file bounded.
