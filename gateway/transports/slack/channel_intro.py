"""First-join channel intro: greet once when the bot is invited to a channel.

Claude Tag posts a short intro on its own when invited to a channel; Slack's
`member_joined_channel` event makes this one handler. The intro explains the
three behaviors people otherwise discover by trial and error: mention to
start, thread-following after a mention, and approval prompts before writes.
Needs the `member_joined_channel` event subscription on the app manifest.
