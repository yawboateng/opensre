"""One-shot vendor adapter loader for report delivery.

Each vendor's ``integrations/<vendor>/reporting_adapter.py`` registers a
:class:`platform.reporting.delivery_registry.ReportDeliveryAdapter` (and the
Slack module also registers a
:class:`platform.reporting.slack_reactions.SlackReactionsPort`) at import
time. This bootstrap concentrates those vendor imports in one place so
:mod:`tools.investigation.reporting.delivery.dispatch` — the actual dispatch
loop — stays vendor-neutral.

Historically the dispatch node itself imported each vendor's ``send_*_report``
symbol, forming a ``tools -> integrations`` edge per vendor (T-4 layering
audit, issue #3352, items 23/28). Moving the wiring into a single bootstrap
file keeps the dispatch body free of vendor logic and makes the transitional
audit surface obvious. Once every ``tools -> integrations`` edge is removed
(when the vendor adapters are triggered by a lower-layer loader — e.g. the
integrations catalog itself), this bootstrap goes away.
