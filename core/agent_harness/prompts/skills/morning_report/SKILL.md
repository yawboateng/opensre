MORNING REPORT SKILL #1 — weather + daily news briefing:
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Recognize a request for a morning briefing — "morning report", "morning
briefing", "daily brief", "give me my morning update", "weather and news
summary", or similar — as a weather+news briefing YOU own end-to-end. This is
a DATA-DEPENDENT chain (see the COMPOUND TURN RULE box): fetch the raw inputs
first with read-only shell commands, WAIT for their results, then YOU compose,
deliver, and offer the schedule (steps 3–5). Do NOT call assistant_handoff and
do NOT start an investigation/gather for this request — that produces a second,
unrelated "status report" after the briefing. Never fabricate weather values or
headlines, and never emit the compose/deliver step in the same response as the
fetches.

OUTPUT MUST BE HUMAN-READABLE — NEVER RAW MARKUP. The fetched feed is raw
RSS/XML/HTML; it is INTERMEDIATE data only. NEVER present the raw feed, XML
tags, CDATA blocks, or angle-bracket markup to the user, and NEVER let a raw
`curl` dump be the final answer. The user only ever sees the composed
plain-text briefing produced in the final step. The news fetch below already
strips the feed down to plain-text headline lines so nothing but readable text
comes back.
STEP LABELING RULES (UX) — the fetches below run quiet, so narrate the 5
steps:
- Before every step's tool calls, emit this exact header format as assistant
  text in the SAME response as the tool calls, then one short status
  sentence:
    ### [n/5] <step name>
    <One-sentence status.>
- Steps 1–2 fire as one parallel batch; label that batch with the combined
  header `### [1-2/5] Fetch weather + headlines`.
- After a step's tool results are in, state its outcome in one line (start
  it with ✓ on success, ✗ plus what failed otherwise) before the next
  step's header (e.g. `### [4/5] Deliver to Slack`).
- Use each step's own number as n; never renumber mid-run. The composed
  briefing itself (step 3) and the schedule offer's response_text (step 5)
  stay exactly as specified below — headers narrate around them, never
  replace them.

Steps, in order:
1) Fetch today's weather with shell_run. Use quiet=true so the $ curl line and
   raw stdout stay off the user's screen — they only need the composed briefing
   in step 3, not the same weather line twice. Use the city the user named; if
   none is given, use their configured/default city, else omit the location:
     → shell_run(command="curl -s 'wttr.in/<city>?format=%l:+%c+%t,+feels+%f,+%h+humidity,+wind+%w'", quiet=true)
2) Fetch current headlines with shell_run as PLAIN TEXT — extract just the
   headline titles from the feed, drop the channel title, and cap the list.
   Also quiet=true (same reason: intermediate fetch, not the user-facing answer).
   Do NOT fetch the raw feed without this extraction pipeline:
     → shell_run(command="curl -s 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml' | grep -oE '<title><!\\[CDATA\\[[^]]*\\]\\]>' | sed -E 's/<title><!\\[CDATA\\[//; s/\\]\\]>//' | sed '1d' | head -n 8", quiet=true)
3) After BOTH tool results are in, compose a clean, human-readable briefing
   from the ACTUAL fetched data. Required format — Markdown/plain text only,
   no HTML/XML, no links, no angle brackets:
     Good morning! Here is your briefing.
     Weather — <city>: <one-line conditions from step 1>
     Top headlines:
     - <headline 1, one short sentence>
     - <headline 2>
     - ... (3–5 bullets total)
4) ALWAYS DELIVER TO SLACK — as the FINAL action of this skill you MUST send the
   WHOLE composed briefing (both the weather/temperature line AND the news
   headlines, exactly as formatted in step 3) to Slack via slack_send_message,
   even when the user did NOT explicitly ask to send it anywhere. This is a
   DATA-DEPENDENT step: emit it on the response AFTER the two fetches, with the
   full composed plain-text briefing in `message` — never raw feed markup, never
   a partial report, never a "preparing…" placeholder. The Slack webhook is bound
   to a single preconfigured channel, so do NOT ask which channel to use. If the
   user names another platform (e.g. "post it to telegram"), ALSO deliver there
   with telegram_send_message; Slack stays the default sink. Skip a platform only
   if it is not connected. If neither delivery tool is available, defer to the
   "Delivery tool unavailable" rule above instead of fabricating a command.
Examples:
- "give me my morning report"
    → shell_run(command="curl -s 'wttr.in/Amsterdam?format=%l:+%c+%t,+feels+%f,+%h+humidity,+wind+%w'", quiet=true)
      + shell_run(command="curl -s 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml' | grep -oE '<title><!\\[CDATA\\[[^]]*\\]\\]>' | sed -E 's/<title><!\\[CDATA\\[//; s/\\]\\]>//' | sed '1d' | head -n 8", quiet=true)   [both this turn — independent fetches]
    → (observe both results)
    → slack_send_message(message="<the FULL composed plain-text weather + headlines briefing>")   [next turn — mandatory Slack delivery]
- "morning briefing for Berlin and post it to telegram"
    → shell_run(command="curl -s 'wttr.in/Berlin?format=%l:+%c+%t,+feels+%f,+%h+humidity,+wind+%w'", quiet=true)
      + shell_run(command="curl -s 'https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml' | grep -oE '<title><!\\[CDATA\\[[^]]*\\]\\]>' | sed -E 's/<title><!\\[CDATA\\[//; s/\\]\\]>//' | sed '1d' | head -n 8", quiet=true)   [both this turn]
    → (observe both results)
    → slack_send_message(message="<the FULL composed briefing>")
      + telegram_send_message(message="<the FULL composed briefing>")   [next turn — Slack always + Telegram because the user named it]

5) AFTER the briefing exists (steps 1–3 done; step 4 delivery attempted),
   ALWAYS offer to make mornings recurring. NEVER call
   propose_scheduled_delivery as the first or only tool of this skill — the
   tool will REJECT that and the user would only see a schedule offer with no
   weather/news. Steps 1–3 must have run first. Call propose_scheduled_delivery
   with briefing_text set to the FULL composed briefing from step 3 (required).
   The tool returns response_text = briefing + closer; show that to the user
   (or at least end with the closer). Do NOT call /cron yet; the user's bare
   "yes" expands to the tool's slash_preview with no LLM round-trip.
   Defaults when they accept without overrides: weekdays 08:00 in their
   timezone if known else UTC, provider matching where you just delivered
   (Slack webhook by default — omit chat_id). Kind is daily_summary.
   Example after Slack webhook delivery:
     → propose_scheduled_delivery(kind="daily_summary", cron="0 8 * * 1-5",
         timezone="UTC", provider="slack",
         briefing_text="<FULL composed weather + headlines briefing>")
     → show the tool's response_text (briefing + Want me to: …)
   Pass chat_id only when you have a concrete Telegram/Discord/Rocket.Chat
   destination (or a Slack #name/C… you already reported). Never invent one.
   Skip the offer only when they already asked for a one-off and explicitly
   declined recurrence earlier in this conversation. A briefing that runs
   once is a demo; a morning that arrives every weekday is the product.
