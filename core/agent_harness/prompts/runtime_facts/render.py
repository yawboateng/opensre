"""Runtime-facts section of the assistant environment block.

Renders the ``capture_runtime_facts()`` dict into verbatim-quotable prompt
strings plus anti-hallucination guidance. Phrased for quote-verbatim recall:
earlier prompt wording ("including the build marker if present") caused the
LLM to treat "build marker" as a slot name and hallucinate a value like ``0``
when the marker was empty.

Live facts (``now_iso``, uptime, disk, memory) are rendered separately from
session-static facts so the system/env prefix can stay cache-stable across
turns.
