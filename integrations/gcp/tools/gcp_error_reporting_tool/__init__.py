"""Error Reporting — what is actually throwing, ranked, already deduplicated.

The shortest path from "something is wrong" to a stack trace. Error Reporting
clusters exceptions into groups server-side, so one query answers what is
failing, how often, since when, and in which service — work that would otherwise
mean several ``gcp_logging_query`` calls and manual grouping.

``firstSeenTime`` is the field that earns this tool its place: it separates a
regression that started during the incident from a long-standing error with the
same count.
