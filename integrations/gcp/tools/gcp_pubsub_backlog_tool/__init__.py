"""Pub/Sub subscription backlog — whether consumers are keeping up.

An asynchronous pipeline fails quietly. Publishers keep succeeding, the API
stays green, and the only evidence that a consumer died is a backlog that grows
and an oldest-message age that climbs. This tool reports both alongside the
subscription configuration that explains them — a missing dead-letter topic, a
push endpoint that is 5xx-ing, a detached subscription receiving nothing.

Two APIs are needed because Pub/Sub splits the answer: ``pubsub/v1`` has the
configuration and ``monitoring/v3`` has the backlog. The join is in
:mod:`.backlog`.
