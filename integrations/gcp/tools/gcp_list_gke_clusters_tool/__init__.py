"""GKE cluster discovery — what clusters exist, and which ones kubectl can reach.

Closes a gap the Kubernetes integration cannot close on its own: that side only
knows about clusters an operator hand-registered as instances. This asks GCP,
so a cluster nobody registered still shows up during an investigation, and each
result says whether the Kubernetes tools can address it (``registered_as``) or
whether the agent is limited to Cloud Logging and Monitoring for it.

Listing is per project — ``container/v1`` scopes ``clusters.list`` by parent —
but the API client is built once per *credential*, so the common
one-credential-many-projects estate pays for a single auth round trip.
