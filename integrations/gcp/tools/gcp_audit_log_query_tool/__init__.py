"""Cloud Audit Logs tool — the CloudTrail analogue for GCP.

Answers the first question of most incident reviews: *what changed, and who
changed it?* Technically this is a Cloud Logging query, and ``gcp_logging_query``
could run the same one — but only if the caller already knows that audit entries
live under ``logName:cloudaudit.googleapis.com`` and that the interesting fields
hang off ``protoPayload``, not ``jsonPayload``. Both are easy to get wrong, and
getting them wrong returns zero entries with no hint of the mistake, which reads
to an agent as "nothing changed". A dedicated tool with named arguments removes
that failure mode.

Like the logging tool, one ``entries.list`` call covers every project reachable
by a single credential.
