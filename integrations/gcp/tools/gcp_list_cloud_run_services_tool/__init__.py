"""Cloud Run inventory — which serverless services exist and what is serving.

The serving tier for GCP estates that never adopted Kubernetes, and the place a
"my deploy did nothing" report resolves: Cloud Run keeps the previous revision
live when a new one fails to become ready, so the service stays healthy while
the change is invisible. ``locations/-`` covers every region in one call per
project, so the agent never has to guess a region.
