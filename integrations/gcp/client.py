"""Google Cloud credential resolution and API client construction.

Built on the discovery-based ``google-api-python-client`` rather than the
per-service ``google-cloud-*`` libraries. ``logging/v2``, ``monitoring/v3`` and
``cloudresourcemanager/v1`` are all reachable through discovery, so this
integration adds no new dependency to the project — which matters here: the
``google-cloud-aiplatform`` import chain has already caused one production
outage when a partner-model route hard-imported a package that was not
installed.

Imports go through :func:`importlib.import_module` behind a ``cast(Any, ...)``,
matching ``integrations/google_docs/client.py``. The Google libraries ship no
type stubs and ``mypy.ini`` sets ``ignore_missing_imports = False`` globally, so
a plain ``import googleapiclient.discovery`` would fail ``make typecheck``.
