"""Per-call project selection for the GCP tools.

Two different things get called "multiple GCP projects", and both are resolved
here:

*One credential, many projects.* GCP inherits IAM down the resource hierarchy,
so a service account granted a viewer role at the folder or organization level
reads every project beneath it — unlike AWS, where each account needs its own
assumed role. Modelling those projects as separate integration *instances*
would duplicate one credential N times, so each tool takes an LLM-supplied
``project`` argument resolved against the configured scope.

*Many credentials.* Estates that do not share a folder need one registered
instance per credential (``GCP_INSTANCES``). Each instance contributes its own
projects to the same flat ``project`` namespace, and
:func:`group_projects` maps a resolved selection back to the credential that
can actually reach each project.

Cloud Logging accepts several ``resourceNames`` in a single ``entries.list``
call, so a cross-project query under one credential is one request rather than
a fan-out — hence this returns a *list*, not a single project.

The ``project`` argument is deliberately absent from every tool's
``injected_params``. Anything listed there is protected and overrides what the
model passes, which is exactly how the Kubernetes ``context`` parameter ended
up inert for cluster selection.
