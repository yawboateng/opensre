"""List GKE clusters with the fields needed to *connect* to them.

A second projection of the same ``container/v1`` listing that backs the
``gcp_list_gke_clusters`` tool, and deliberately not shared with it. The tool
answers "what is wrong with this cluster" for a language model and drops the
endpoint and CA certificate, which are bulky and useless to a model. This
answers "how do I reach this cluster" for the registration flow and keeps
almost nothing else.

Error handling differs for the same reason: the tool degrades a per-project
failure into a ``partial_errors`` entry the model reads, while here the reader
is an operator at a terminal who is told which projects were skipped and why.
