"""Register discovered GKE clusters when a long-running process starts.

``opensre integrations add-gke-clusters`` writes to the on-disk integration
store. That is the right place on a workstation and the wrong place in a
container: the store lives in the container filesystem, so it is lost on every
restart and invisible to a second replica. Without this module an operator has
to ``kubectl exec`` into each pod after each rollout, and nothing surfaces the
omission until an investigation reaches for a ``kubernetes_*`` tool and finds
none.

**Opt-in, deliberately.** Registering a cluster widens what the agent can read.
Every ``kubernetes_*`` tool is read-only today — the client's resource dispatch
holds ``read_*`` calls and nothing else, and Secrets are not fetchable — but
read-only is not harmless: ``kubernetes_get_pod_logs`` and
``kubernetes_list_configmaps`` routinely surface credentials and personal data,
and whatever they return lands in LLM context and in investigation reports.
"Every cluster my credential can enumerate is now a source" is a policy decision
an operator should make explicitly, not a side effect of a boot sequence — so
nothing happens unless :data:`GCP_AUTO_REGISTER_GKE_ENV` says so. Scope is bounded three
times over: to the projects that variable names, to the projects the GCP
integration is already configured for (``resolve_projects`` rejects anything
else) so even ``true`` cannot reach an estate nobody configured, and — when an
entry is written ``project/cluster`` — to the named clusters inside them. See
:mod:`integrations.gcp.gke.scope` for that grammar.

**Runs on a daemon thread.** Discovery is several round trips to
``container.googleapis.com`` and verification one more per cluster. Inline, that
puts a remote call in front of the web readiness probe: a slow control plane
would fail readiness for a reason unrelated to the app. On a daemon thread a
slow call costs nothing and cannot delay process exit. The cost is a window
after boot in which the clusters are not yet registered; a turn arriving inside
it sees the tools as unavailable, which is the same state as not opting in.

**Repeats on a cadence.** A cluster created after boot was invisible until
someone restarted the pod, which in a deployment nobody restarts on purpose
means "until the next release". The thread therefore re-runs registration every
:data:`GCP_GKE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_ENV` seconds; setting that to ``0`` restores the
single boot-time run.

Re-running is safe because registration is **additive**: it registers clusters
it finds and leaves everything else alone. It never removes an instance, not
even one it created. That asymmetry is deliberate — a transient
``container.googleapis.com`` error is indistinguishable from a deleted cluster
from here, and the two call for opposite actions. Pruning would mean a bad
minute at Google silently disconnects a healthy cluster mid-investigation; not
pruning means a genuinely deleted cluster lingers as an instance whose tools
fail with a connection error that says so. The second is the better failure.

    integration?" Only classification answers that, so this runs the env records
    through the same classifier the tools read and looks for the service there.

    Each cheaper check fails on a real input:

    * **The variable's presence.** ``KUBERNETES_INSTANCES`` takes a JSON array of
      instance objects; a bare cluster name does not parse, so the loader warns
      and falls through, and the variable contributes nothing.
    * **A record from the loader.** An entry carrying ``name`` and ``tags`` but no
      ``credentials`` parses into a perfectly good-looking record — and the
      classifier then drops it, because an instance with no kubeconfig cannot
      connect to anything.

    Both leave the operator with neither: no env-declared clusters, no
    auto-registered ones, and no ``kubernetes`` integration at all, from config
    that looks set. Deferring only to an environment that actually works is what
    keeps this guard from being a worse footgun than the one it prevents.

    It is also broader than one variable by design: ``KUBECONFIG_CONTENT`` /
