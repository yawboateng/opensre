"""Register discovered GKE clusters as named Kubernetes instances.

``gcp_list_gke_clusters`` reports which clusters have no kubeconfig registered
and therefore cannot be reached by the ``kubernetes_*`` tools. That report is a
dead end for the operator unless something closes it, which is what this does:
discover, synthesize a kubeconfig, and hand it to
:func:`integrations.kubernetes.clusters.add_cluster` — the same path
``opensre integrations add-cluster`` already uses, so verification, storage and
naming behave identically whether a cluster was added by hand or found here.

Pure orchestration: discovery lives in :mod:`.discovery`, kubeconfig synthesis
in :mod:`.kubeconfig`, and persistence in the Kubernetes integration. Nothing
here talks to an API or a store directly, which is why the whole flow is
testable with two fakes.
