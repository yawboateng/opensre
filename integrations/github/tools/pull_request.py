"""Action-surface tool: open a GitHub pull request without a clone.

The gateway container ships no ``git`` and no ``gh``, so every existing write
path (``github_cli``, ``fix_github_security_alert``) is unreachable from a chat
turn — the agent could describe a fix but never propose one. This tool closes
that gap over the REST API alone: branch, commit, pull request, three calls, no
working copy.

It is gated twice. ``requires_approval`` puts Approve / Deny buttons in front of
every call, so nothing is written until a human clicks; and the write itself can
only ever create a new branch, so the worst an approved-by-mistake call produces
is a pull request somebody has to merge.
