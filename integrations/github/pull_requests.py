"""Open GitHub pull requests.

:func:`create_pull_request` is the REST call on its own: give it an owner/repo
and two branch names and it opens the PR. :func:`open_pull_request` wraps it for
callers that have a local checkout, resolving the target repository from the
workspace's ``origin`` remote first — the workspace is the only part that needs
``git``, which is why the two are separate.

Tokens are resolved through the existing GitHub credential helper and never
appear in the returned payload.
