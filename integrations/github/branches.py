"""Create a branch carrying file edits, with no clone and no ``git`` binary.

The Git Data API is the only write path open to a process that has neither
``git`` nor a checkout — the gateway container has neither. Blob contents are
described inline, hung off the base commit's tree, committed, and pointed at by
a brand-new ref. One call produces exactly one commit, so a multi-file fix lands
atomically and a failure part-way through leaves no branch behind.

Every path here *creates* ``refs/heads/<new_branch>`` or fails. Nothing updates a
ref that already exists, so this module cannot move the base branch however it is
called — the only way a change reaches ``main`` is a human merging the pull
request.
