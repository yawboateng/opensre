"""Incident sinks for the Hermes agent.

The Hermes agent emits :class:`HermesIncident` objects to a pluggable
``IncidentSink`` callable. This module provides the concrete sinks used
in production:

* :class:`TelegramSink` — formats an incident into a human-readable
  Telegram message and routes it through :class:`AlarmDispatcher` so
  duplicate incidents respect the per-fingerprint cooldown. For
  ``HIGH``/``CRITICAL`` incidents it can optionally trigger the OpenSRE
  investigation pipeline and append the resulting root-cause summary to
  the Telegram message before delivery.
* :func:`make_telegram_sink` — convenience factory returning an
  :data:`IncidentSink` callable bound to an existing
  :class:`AlarmDispatcher` (and optional investigation bridge).

The sink is intentionally *defensive*: any exception raised by the
investigation bridge or by Telegram delivery is logged but does not
re-raise. A buggy bridge must never silently disable incident
notifications.

Investigation bridge execution model
------------------------------------

Investigation calls (LLM round-trips via the investigation agent) can take 30+
seconds. To keep the agent's polling thread responsive — so the
``FileTailer`` keeps reading and the classifier keeps observing during
an investigation — bridge calls are dispatched to a bounded thread pool
and waited on with a configurable timeout. When the investigation
completes within budget its summary is appended to the Telegram body;
otherwise the sink falls back to a clearly-marked notification so the
operator can distinguish:

* **no bridge configured** → no investigation section
* **bridge attempted, returned None** → ``investigation: attempted (no
  summary produced)``
* **bridge attempted, raised** → ``investigation: attempted (failed —
  see server logs)``
* **bridge attempted, timed out** → ``investigation: attempted (timed
  out after N.Ns — see server logs)``
* **bridge attempted, returned summary** → ``investigation summary:`` block
