"""Efficient, cursor-based polling primitive for Hermes log files.

This module is the **shared engine** behind both the agent-facing
``HermesLogsTool`` (``integrations.hermes.tools.hermes_logs_tool``) and the test helper
(``tests.utils.hermes_logs_helper``). Centralising the cursor logic
here means the production tool and the test suite never drift.

Design goals
------------

* **O(new-lines) per poll** — never re-read the entire log on each
  call. A :class:`HermesLogCursor` records the file's identity (path,
  device, inode) and last byte offset; subsequent polls seek directly
  to the offset and read only what is new.
* **Rotation- and truncation-safe** — every poll re-stat's the file
  and resets the offset if the inode changed (rotation) or the size
  shrank (truncation), so an active poller never silently misses
  lines after ``logrotate`` runs.
* **No daemon thread required** — the agent calls this from its main
  loop and the test helper from a single test thread. For the
  background-polling case the existing ``HermesAgent`` already wraps
  ``FileTailer``; this module is the synchronous primitive both rely
  on.
* **Bounded** — ``max_lines`` caps a single poll so a multi-GB rotated
  file can't blow up the caller's memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_path:
        Path to the Hermes log file (typically
        ``~/.hermes/logs/errors.log``).
    cursor:
        Resume position. ``None`` means "start from offset 0" and is
        equivalent to passing ``HermesLogCursor.at_start(log_path)``.
    max_lines:
        Cap on records returned per poll. ``None`` disables the cap.
        When the cap is hit, ``truncated_lines`` reports how many
        records were left behind; the returned cursor still advances
        past the records that were yielded so a follow-up poll picks
        up where we left off.
    classifier:
        Optional :class:`IncidentClassifier`. When provided, every
        parsed record is fed through it and the emitted incidents are
        included in :class:`HermesLogPoll`. Passing the same
        classifier instance across polls preserves traceback buffering
        / warning-burst windows across calls — that's the contract the
        agent and the test helper rely on.
    level_filter:
        Optional set of :class:`LogLevel` values to retain. When set,
        records of other levels are still **observed by the classifier**
        (so traceback continuations and warning bursts still work) but
        are dropped from the returned ``records`` tuple. Defaults to no
        filter.
    since:
        Drop records with ``timestamp < since`` from the returned
        records. As with ``level_filter``, the classifier still
        observes them so cross-poll burst windows remain intact.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`HermesLogPoll` with the new records, any incidents the
    classifier emitted, an updated cursor, and rotation/truncation
    flags.

      an :meth:`HermesLogCursor.at_start` cursor — a follow-up poll
      after the file is created will read from offset 0.
    * **Permission error:** raised — the caller is expected to surface
      this through their normal error path (the tool serialises it
      into a ``{"error": ...}`` response).
