"""Hermes agent: glue between the file tailer, parser, classifier, and sinks.

Public surface is :class:`HermesAgent`. Construct one with the path to a
Hermes log file (defaults to ``~/.hermes/logs/errors.log``) and a callable
that handles each detected :class:`HermesIncident`. Call :meth:`start` to
spawn the polling thread, :meth:`stop` to shut it down, or use the agent
as a context manager for guaranteed cleanup.

The agent is *I/O bounded*: a single daemon thread polls the log file and
synchronously runs the parser/classifier/sink pipeline. This is fine for
log files written at human-scale rates (Hermes' ``errors.log`` is in the
single-digit lines/second at peak); higher-rate files should consider a
queue between the tailer and the classifier in a follow-up.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sink:
        Callable invoked for each detected incident. Exceptions raised by
        the sink are logged but do not stop the polling loop — a buggy
        sink must not silently disable incident detection.
    log_path:
        Path to the Hermes log file. Defaults to
        ``~/.hermes/logs/errors.log``.
    classifier:
        Optional pre-configured :class:`IncidentClassifier`. Construct one
        explicitly when you need non-default thresholds; otherwise the
        agent creates a classifier with the module defaults.
    poll_interval_s, from_start:
        Forwarded to :class:`FileTailer`. ``from_start=True`` replays the
        existing file contents before live tailing, which is useful for
        one-shot scans and tests.
