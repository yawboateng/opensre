# Unified Dockerfile for OpenSRE
# Supports two runtime modes via MODE environment variable:
#   MODE=web      - FastAPI web API (health, alerts, async investigations)
#   MODE=gateway  - Two-way messaging gateway (Slack Socket Mode + Telegram)
#
# Web mode usage:
#   docker build -t opensre:latest .
#   docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env opensre:latest
#   curl http://localhost:8000/health
#
# Gateway mode usage:
#   docker build -t opensre-gateway:latest .
#   docker run -e MODE=gateway --env-file .env opensre-gateway:latest
#
# Required env vars for gateway mode:
#   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN + SLACK_APP_TOKEN (Slack) and/or TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN +
#   TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS (Telegram), plus LLM_PROVIDER and API keys

# --- gke-gcloud-auth-plugin ---------------------------------------------------
# A GKE kubeconfig — whether written by `opensre integrations add-gke-clusters`
# or by `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` — carries no credential. It
# execs `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` to mint a token per connection. Without that
# binary on PATH the kubernetes_* tools cannot reach any GKE cluster from inside
# this image, and add-gke-clusters refuses to write a kubeconfig at all.
#
# Only the ~10MB binary is taken. `apt-get install` would pull in
# google-cloud-cli (~1GB) as a dependency, which nothing else here needs:
# `apt-get download` fetches the .deb without its dependencies and `dpkg-deb -x`
# unpacks it without running maintainer scripts. The .deb is architecture-
# specific, so this stage must build for the same platform as the final image.

# Dependencies come from uv.lock, not from the ranges in pyproject.toml.
#
# `pip install .` re-resolves every range at build time, so the image drifts away
# from the versions CI tests the moment an upstream release lands — and it does so
# silently, with no diff and no failing test. That is not hypothetical: an image
# built this way resolved mcp 2.0.0 against a lock pinning 1.28.1, and the two
# breaking changes in between (a transport yield arity, then `CallToolResult
# .isError`) each surfaced as a runtime AttributeError in a deployed pod, on a
# code path CI had exercised green minutes earlier.
#
# `uv export` flattens the lock to a pinned requirements file with hashes; pip
# installs exactly that, then the project itself with --no-deps so nothing is
# re-resolved behind it. uv is pinned too and uninstalled afterwards — it is a
# build tool, not a runtime dependency.
#
# postgresql extra: psycopg2 for the DATABASE_URL-backed investigations store.
